        Detailed Instructions for Creating a Polished Certificate Generator with
        Next.js and ShadCN UI 1. Project Setup and Initialization Initialize
        Next.js Project Create a new Next.js project using the App Router Enable
        TypeScript for type safety Configure Tailwind CSS for styling Set up
        ESLint for code quality Install ShadCN UI Initialize ShadCN UI in your
        project Configure the ShadCN components library Install necessary
        dependencies for the components Install Additional Dependencies Add
        html2canvas for capturing certificate elements as images Add jspdf for
        PDF generation Include date-fns for date formatting utilities Add
        Required ShadCN Components Install core UI components: card, input,
        button, label, textarea, select, table Configure these components with
        your project's theme Type Definitions Define TypeScript Interfaces
        Create interfaces for certificate data: Student information Event
        details Medal types Date information Define types for batch processing
        entries Create types for medal configuration 4. Utility Functions
        General Utilities Create a utility for merging CSS classes Implement
        date formatting functions Add text transformation utilities
        Certificate-Specific Utilities Implement medal assignment logic based on
        rank Create functions to parse batch data from text input Develop
        ranking algorithms that handle ties correctly Export Utilities Implement
        PNG export functionality using html2canvas Create PDF export
        functionality using jsPDF Develop batch PDF export for multiple
        certificates 5. Component Implementation Certificate Display Component
        Create a visually appealing certificate layout Implement the ribbon
        design at the top Add the logo and brand name section Design the main
        content area with: Certificate title Event name display Student name
        section Medal badge with rank Metadata chips (rank, tests, date) Add the
        teachers' image at the bottom Ensure the design is responsive and
        scalable Certificate Form Component Create a form with fields for:
        Student name Rank Tests attempted Event name Date Medal type (with auto
        option) Implement form validation Add action buttons for preview and
        export Use ShadCN components for consistent styling Certificate Preview
        Component Implement responsive scaling for the certificate Add overflow
        handling for smaller screens Ensure the certificate maintains its aspect
        ratio Add loading states during export operations Batch Processing
        Component Create a textarea for batch data input Implement data parsing
        logic Create a table to display processed data: Rank Student name Tests
        attempted Medal type Action buttons Add functionality to export
        individual certificates Implement combined PDF export for all
        certificates 6. Main Page Implementation Layout Design Create a
        responsive grid layout Position the form and preview side-by-side on
        larger screens Stack components vertically on smaller screens State
        Management Use React hooks for state management Implement form state
        handling Manage batch data state Handle loading states during exports
        Integration of Components Combine all components on the main page
        Implement data flow between components Add error handling and user
        feedback 7. Styling and Polish Global Styles Define CSS variables for
        colors and spacing Configure typography with Poppins and Playfair
        Display fonts Set up consistent spacing and sizing Responsive Design
        Implement responsive breakpoints Ensure components adapt to different
        screen sizes Optimize touch targets for mobile devices User Experience
        Enhancements Add loading indicators during exports Implement toast
        notifications for user feedback Add helpful tooltips and instructions
        Ensure keyboard accessibility Visual Polish Add subtle animations and
        transitions Implement hover states for interactive elements Ensure
        consistent spacing and alignment Add visual feedback for form validation
